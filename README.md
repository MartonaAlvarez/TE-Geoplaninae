# TE-Geoplaninae
Scripts and datasets for the bayesian analyses of total evidence for the phylogeny of Geoplaninae (Platyhelminthes: Tricladida)

The scripts have been created to be run on revbayes and consider three different types of datasets. One is only for morphological data, applying the mk model; the second is for the molecular matrices, with a partitioned analysis applying the GTR+G model of evolution; and the third is for a Total Evidence analysis with morphological and molecular data. For the molecular data the GTR+G model and for the morphological matrix the mk model have been applied.
